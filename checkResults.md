Brewery API returns first 20 only when is requested without params. Your results are incomplete!
Class fields must have been extracted explicitly
Redundant one-line comments
Too complicated output. There were no need in AJAX! 
Too splitted code. I see lots of microfunctions are called, but the sense of it all is not visible. You should have created more symanthic functions for calling in server
